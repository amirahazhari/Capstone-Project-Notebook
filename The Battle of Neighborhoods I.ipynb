This venture is for those individuals who are searching for better neighborhoods.

The highlights incorporate middle lodging cost and better school as indicated by appraisals, crime percentages of that specific region, street availability, climate conditions, great administration for crisis, water assets both fresh and waste water and stool passed on in sewers and recreational offices. \n\nIt will help individuals to get familiarity with the territory and neighborhood before moving to another city, state, nation or spot for their work or to begin another new life."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "<h2> Problem Statement</h2>"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "1.
